# bar_plot_from_csv

bash script using python. 

input: any file, convert it into .csv 
with numpy and matplotlib.pyplot create bins, bins categories, trace barplot and smoothed line from it. Value of 5 was used for the windows size for smoothing line part.

Improvement : convert any file into csv even .csv file. shouldnt be an issue
